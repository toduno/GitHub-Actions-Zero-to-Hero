# GitHub Actions - 
1. platform-oriented solutions and doesn't support many tools e.g. other vcs like gitlab, bitbucket as this is strictly for GitHub vcs
2. Don't need to install plugins, by default Github seamlessly integrates with the actions file, provides what's required and executes the job (same as pipeline in Jenkins) in the actions file/pipelines 
e.g. on: [push/pull] - irrespective of what push/pull/issue action, once defined Github will look into the action then watch for the CI files and understand what needs to be done and start executing the actions file
3. Pipelines or actions files can be created in a .github/workflows folder in the root folder of the repo
   and it follos the yaml standard
4. You can have multiple pipelines or actions files e.g. one to check pull reqs maybe a user has provided all details in the pull req or not, one to verify formatting/linking issues, one to check if CI is passing, one for CD, others (sample from argo-cd workflos: release.yml, ci-build.yml, codequality.yml, image.yaml, pr-title-check.yml, update-sync-for-vulnerabilities.yml) - all boils down to what you want to do, and whatever actions you configure e.g. on: [push,pull,issue] - Github doesn't mind executing your pipelines on the actions you provided. If you provide 3 actions it'll know that either of the action has to be matched before it starts executing the pipeline.
5. You can have multiple jobs in one file which is like executing multiple pipelines in one file
